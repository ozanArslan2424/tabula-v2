# README
A simple and markdown compatible note taking web app. It's main purpose is to provide a more natural note taking experience by taking advantage of sideways notes stacking that isn't usually included for digital note taking apps, providing a notebook-like experience.

## Instructions:
There are two ways you can try out this web app.

### A. Self-hosted
1. Clone this repository
2. `npm i` to install dependencies (there isn't that many of them)
3. Use a web based postgresql database with an API key OR create a local postgresql database using docker and configure Drizzle ORM.
4. Create an account.
5. Start creating books and taking notes.

**WARNING:** The demo account will expire in one week and your account will be deleted. You can download your notes as markdown files or just copy and paste them as you wish.
**WARNING:** Since this web app is intended for my personal use, your notes **will not be private**, I can easily read through them. You are just going to need to trust me to not share them with anyone. However, your account details are *obviously* encrypted.
